# Game Maker Highscores

This is the source code for [gmhighscores.com](http://gmhighscores.com). I wrote this code quite literally in middle school, so don't expect any kind of beautiful, well-laid-out code.

This code is licensed under the MIT license, as specified in `license.md`, although I would appreciate it if you would change the logos so as to not confuse people between your site and the original GMH site.

### Installation

GMH requires a PHP server with MYSQL.

You'll need to specify your database details in `souphouse.php`. (I have no idea why I chose to name that file `souphouse`.) Additionally, you'll need to set up your database structure as specified in `db.sql`.
